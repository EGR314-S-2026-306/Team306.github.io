## Exploration Devices 

A surface‑sampling exploration device is designed to directly interact with the ground in order to collect physical material for analysis. Its primary goal is to gather soil, rock, sediment, or other surface‑level samples that can reveal the chemical, geological, or biological characteristics of an environment. By physically retrieving material and relying on remote sensing, the device provides an example of what the surface is made of and how it has changed over time. This hands‑on approach allows researchers to study composition, structure, and environmental conditions with a level of detail that other observation‑only tools can’t match.

The audience for a surface‑sampling device is likely going to include scientists, engineers, and research teams who need accurate, lab‑quality data from locations that are difficult or unsafe to reach. In academic settings, these devices also support students learning about field methods, planetary science, or environmental analysis. Depending on the mission, they may also be used by environmental specialists, geologists, or industrial teams working in remote or hazardous areas. Regardless of the specific user group, the device is built to deliver reliable, well‑documented samples that help people better understand the environment they are studying.
