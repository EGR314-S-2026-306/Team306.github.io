## Project Objective Overview

The objective of this project is to create a subterranean rover that uses motors to drill into the ground and collect samples from different soil types and environments. The rover will be equipped with resistive sensors to measure chemical compositions in the soil, allowing it to determine which samples to collect and which to ignore.
Our rover will also feature a human‑machine interface, giving the operator the ability to set various conditions and define routes for the rover to follow. In addition, the rover will include wireless communication, enabling it to receive instructions from the user without the need for wired connections.


## Table of Requirements

This is just a placeholder table for now: 

| **Role      | Duties | kjhvh | hbkljh |  
|----|------|------|----|
| yugkjyg   | hyguyg     | ykjyg | hyguyg |  
|  yugkjyg  | hyguyg     | ykjyg | hyguyg |  
|   yugkjyg | hyguyg     | ykjyg | hyguyg |  



A table that lists the requirements, as a description, along with the minimum measure level to not be a complete failure, the target measurement, the feature this requirement satisfies, and whether it is a stretch requirement. (See the Individual datasheet template for an example.)

This table should also cover the major design-concept constraints that will affect team-member modules. Like power.
Should cover every feature of the exploration device has in the final design concept.
Should have enough requirements that every team member has a key functional requirement. Motor, sensor, wireless communication, or HMI.

## Team Member assignment

The table below shows what team Member will be responsible for what function of the Rover.

The mimnimum Funtionalities for our rover being:

* Human Interface 
* Sensor 
* Wireless Connection
* Motor

## Features 

**Motor:** 

Our subterranean rover will need to drill into a variety of soil compositions to collect samples. This will be achieved using motor‑driven mechanisms that rotate the drill bit and extract material from beneath the surface 

**Wireless Connection:** 

The rover must be capable of receiving commands without any wired connection. To support this, it will include wireless communication capabilities that allow the operator to send movement instructions, adjust settings, and monitor rover status remotely.

**Sensor:**

The subterranean rover will be equipped with resistive sensors designed to detect differences in soil composition, moisture levels, and pH balance. These measurements will help the rover determine which areas contain valuable samples and guide its collection decisions.

**Human Interface:**
 
A human‑machine interface will be integrated to allow the operator to issue commands based on real‑time sensor readings. This interface will provide clear feedback about soil conditions, drilling progress, and rover status, enabling the user to make informed operational decisions.
