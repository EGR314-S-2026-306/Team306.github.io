## Project Objective Overview

The objective of this project is to create a subterranean rover that uses motors to drill into the ground and collect samples from different soil types and environments. The rover will be equipped with resistive sensors to measure chemical compositions in the soil, allowing it to determine which samples to collect and which to ignore.
Our rover will also feature a human‑machine interface, giving the operator the ability to set various conditions and define routes for the rover to follow. In addition, the rover will include wireless communication, enabling it to receive instructions from the user without the need for wired connections.


## Table of Requirements

The tables below shows the minimum acceptable performance levels, target values, associated rover features, and stretch‑goal indicators for each requirement in the final subterranean rover design. It includes all major system constraints—such as power limits, drilling capability, sensor accuracy, wireless communication reliability, and human‑machine interface functionality—and ensures that every subsystem of the rover is represented so each team member has at least one key functional requirement tied to their module.

| Requirements  | Description | Feature | Target Measurement | Stretch Goal | 
|----|------|------|---|---|
| Sensor   | Rover will be equipped with Sensors for dirt composition    | Soil sensor inside Rover Container | Accurate Ph balance |  no
|  Motor | Motors will be used to drill into ground     | Drill attached to Rover | Drills into different soil compositions |  no
|   Human Interface | Operator will be able to interact with Rover giving it driving and drilling instructions     | LCD display and command pad | Rover obeys different commands based on intruction |  no
|   Wirless Communication | Rover Will be able to recieve commands without wired connections     | Remote control | Rover follow commands of operator without being directly connected |  no

## Features 

**Motor:** 

Our subterranean rover will need to drill into a variety of soil compositions to collect samples. This will be achieved using motor‑driven mechanisms that rotate the drill bit and extract material from beneath the surface 

**Wireless Connection:** 

The rover must be capable of receiving commands without any wired connection. To support this, it will include wireless communication capabilities that allow the operator to send movement instructions, adjust settings, and monitor rover status remotely.

**Sensor:**

The subterranean rover will be equipped with resistive sensors designed to detect differences in soil composition, moisture levels, and pH balance. These measurements will help the rover determine which areas contain valuable samples and guide its collection decisions.

**Human Interface:**
 
A human‑machine interface will be integrated to allow the operator to issue commands based on real‑time sensor readings. This interface will provide clear feedback about soil conditions, drilling progress, and rover status, enabling the user to make informed operational decisions.
