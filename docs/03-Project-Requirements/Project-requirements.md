## Project Objective Overview

The objective of this project is to create a subterranean rover that uses motors to drill into the ground and collect samples from different soil types and environments. The rover will be equipped with resistive sensors to measure chemical compositions in the soil, allowing it to determine which samples to collect and which to ignore.
Our rover will also feature a human‑machine interface, giving the operator the ability to set various conditions and define routes for the rover to follow. In addition, the rover will include wireless communication, enabling it to receive instructions from the user without the need for wired connections.


## Table of Requirements

This is just a placeholder table for now: 

| **Role**          | **Duties**                                                                                                                                | 
| :---------------- | :---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Meeting leader    | Schedules team meetings, creates and distributes an agenda for each meeting, and runs each meeting                                        |
| Meeting recorder  | Takes minutes of each team meeting, including attendance, and records action items and to whom they are assigned                          |
| Assignment leader | Coordinates the team's work on a given assignment to Canvas before the due date                                                           |
| Project monitor   | Tracks the team's progress relative to the project schedule (Gantt chart) and keeps team members apprised of deadlines and project status |



A table that lists the requirements, as a description, along with the minimum measure level to not be a complete failure, the target measurement, the feature this requirement satisfies, and whether it is a stretch requirement. (See the Individual datasheet template for an example.)

This table should also cover the major design-concept constraints that will affect team-member modules. Like power.
Should cover every feature of the exploration device has in the final design concept.
Should have enough requirements that every team member has a key functional requirement. Motor, sensor, wireless communication, or HMI.

## Team Member assignment

The table below shows what team Member will be responsible for what function of the Rover.

The mimnimum Funtionalities being:

* Human Interface 
* Sensor 
* Wireless Connection
* Motor


| **Team Member**          | **Assignment**                                                                                                                                |

## Features 

Written context to guide the reader on how features became requirements. (ie: The ground exploration rover will need drive and steering to move around, which requires ....  OR To collect samples, the explorer will require an arm that ....  which allows it to get the sample.)
