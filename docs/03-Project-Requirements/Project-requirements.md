## Project Objective Overview

The objective of this project is to create a subterranean rover that uses motors to drill into the ground and collect samples from different soil types and environments. The rover will be equipped with resistive sensors to measure chemical compositions in the soil, allowing it to determine which samples to collect and which to ignore.
Our rover will also feature a human‑machine interface, giving the operator the ability to set various conditions and define routes for the rover to follow. In addition, the rover will include wireless communication, enabling it to receive instructions from the user without the need for wired connections.


## Table of Requirements

This is just a placeholder table for now: 

| **Role      | Duties | kjhvh | hbkljh |  
|----|------|------|----|
| yugkjyg   | hyguyg     | ykjyg | hyguyg |  
|  yugkjyg  | hyguyg     | ykjyg | hyguyg |  
|   yugkjyg | hyguyg     | ykjyg | hyguyg |  



A table that lists the requirements, as a description, along with the minimum measure level to not be a complete failure, the target measurement, the feature this requirement satisfies, and whether it is a stretch requirement. (See the Individual datasheet template for an example.)

This table should also cover the major design-concept constraints that will affect team-member modules. Like power.
Should cover every feature of the exploration device has in the final design concept.
Should have enough requirements that every team member has a key functional requirement. Motor, sensor, wireless communication, or HMI.

## Team Member assignment

The table below shows what team Member will be responsible for what function of the Rover.

The mimnimum Funtionalities being:

* Human Interface 
* Sensor 
* Wireless Connection
* Motor

## Features 

**Motor:** 

Our subterranian rover will need to be able to drill into different soil compositions for collection. This will be accomplished using motors to spin the drill and collect dirt samples. 

**Wireless Connection:** 

**Sensor:**

**Human Interface:**

Human interface will be included to give operational commands to the rover based on soil sample readings. This will give the 



Written context to guide the reader on how features became requirements. (ie: The ground exploration rover will need drive and steering to move around, which requires ....  OR To collect samples, the explorer will require an arm that ....  which allows it to get the sample.)
