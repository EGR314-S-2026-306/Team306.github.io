To guarantee that each member is prepared for their responsibilities, we will share resources, help each other where possible, and adjust assignments when additional guidance is needed. Feedback from design reviews will be documented in our communication channel, with clear action items assigned and tracked until completion. If a member misses a contribution or fails to meet expectations, the team will first address the issue through disscussion, offering support and strategies for improvement.
