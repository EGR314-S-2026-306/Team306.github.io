Its primary goal is to gather soil, rock, sediment, or other surface\u2011level samples that can reveal the chemical, geological, or biological characteristics of an environment. By physically retrieving material and relying on remote sensing, the device provides an example of what the surface is made of and how it has changed over time. This hands\u2011on approach allows researchers to study composition, structure, and environmental conditions with a level of detail that other observation\u2011only tools can\u2019t match.</p> <p>The audience for a surface\u2011sampling device is likely going to include scientists, engineers, and research teams who need accurate, lab\u2011quality data from locations that are difficult or unsafe to reach. In academic settings, these devices also support students learning about field methods, planetary science, or environmental analysis. Depending on the mission, they may also be used by environmental specialists, geologists, or industrial teams working in remote or hazardous areas. Regardless of the specific user group, the device is built to deliver reliable, well\u2011documented samples that help people better understand the environment they are studying.</p>"},{"location":"02-Concept-Design/Design/#generate-ideas","title":"Generate Ideas","text":"<p>Our Team each genrate roughly 25 ideas per member.

Its surface sampling scoop, subsurface drill, multi-tool sampling head, and replaceable sample cartridges emphasize hands-on design of functional mechanisms. The onboard mini-lab\u2014including chemical composition scanning, soil moisture and pH sensing, microbial detection, and microscopy\u2014fulfills sensing, instrumentation, and data analysis requirements. User interaction and system control are addressed through joystick navigation, a touchscreen interface, LED status indicators, and clear visual guides, while wireless data upload, real-time 3D model generation, and long-life solar-assisted power demonstrate systems integration and autonomy.
